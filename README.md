Day by day people who know their local units of measurement are becoming less and new generations are having no idea about it. A few days ago, I as a student don't know about those calculations and conversions😕. But our land, site, home and all other property documents are in those units only😔. Because those documents were made before my birth. After getting a reference from the internet I understood these conversions😊. When I met my uncle who is old but an expert in these type of calculations with those conversions he pointed to a precision error😕 in that internet source which leads to an error of 40 Sq.ft for a one-acre calculation😔.

I wonder to share that even google is making the same mistake with its online converter.🤯

I was already learning Full Stack Web Development and made a few projects🧑‍💻. As a responsible person, I took responsibility for removing that error and publishing my accurate converter for our local units😤. Because after a few generations, people will blindly follow internet resources. So, in my view, they must be as accurate as possible.

🤝Thanks to my uncle who pointed out this mistake and thanks🤝 to my instructors who gave me the skills to accomplish this project.
